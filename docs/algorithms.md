# Graph algorithms

  Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes, and relationships. They are iterative approaches that frequently traverse the graph for computation using a variety of different approaches, such as:

  1. Random walks
  2. Breadth-first searches
  3. Depth-first searches
  4. Pattern matching
  
  Though, as the dataset grows in complexity, the distance to retrieve all data points given by a query increase, resulting in higher computation times. Neo4j provides optimized approaches to executing these algorithms by caching previously explored portions of the tree, and parallezing identifiable areas within queries to optimize execution time. Other graphing databases, such as the upcoming TigerGraph, does a similar approach as this.

  From the records gained during queries, relevancy can be identified between entities through clustering and centralities. Centrality is measured by the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.

   Further details will be explained here (Work In Progress)
