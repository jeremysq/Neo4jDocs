# Neo4j Graph Databases Documentation

This repository involves the study of graph databases using the Neo4j graph database software. Neo4j is available in two editions:
1. Community Edition
2. Enterprise Edition

The difference in version is the amount of computational resources that can be allocated to the software. In the Enterprise edition, Neo4j can utilize any amount of CPU cores, while in the Community Edition, only up to 4 CPUs can be used. There are many other benefits that the Enterprise edition entails, but
**In this repository, the Enterprise Edition will be used.** Both are easily accessbile through depending on the configurations initally provided when creating the database.

This repository is split into two portions, an overview on the Graph Data Science Library module, and an applications portion for testing and setting up a Neo4j instance.
